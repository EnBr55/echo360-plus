# Echo360+
### Various improvements to the Echo360 video streamer/downloader

[Chrome Web Store Listing](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/echo360%20/golfblfimaaodgjjagigkahbbhbagndl?hl=en&gl=AU&authuser=1)


The current features are listed below.

1. *Better file names when you download videos*  
Instead of downloading lectures as hd1.mp4, lectures are downloaded with informative file names. This is especially useful when you are downloading multiple lectures from different units at once.
e.g. "hd1.mp4" -> "DATA1001-2019-09-29.mp4"

2. *More video playback speed options*  
Previously the lectures were limited to playback speeds of between 0.5x and 2x. This extension adds 4 faster playback options (2.25x, 2.50x, 2.75x, 3.00x) for those especially slow lecturers.

3. *Add day to lecture date strings*  
By default, Echo360 displays the date (e.g. 4th Aug), but not the day (e.g. Wednesday) on the list of lectures for a particular unit.
As most people usually associated lectures times with days rather than dates, I often find myself opening a calendar app to check the date a particular lecture was run, when simply displaying the day would be enough information to deduce this myself.
Thus, this extension also adds a small 3 letter day string next to each lecture.

4. *Re-position the view lecture popup*  
For some reason, the view lecture popup is always partially hidden behind the right hand side of the page. Echo360+ moves this popup back into the page where it should already be.

5. *Allow hiding of future lectures*  
By default, Echo360 will display all lectures (including those not released yet), and does not provide a feature to hide them.
This extension add a checkbox to do exactly that which is enabled by default.

More features coming soon!

Note:
This extension was made specifically for the USyd lecture system, and as a result some features may not work with your own university.
